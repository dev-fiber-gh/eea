Years ago i looked for information about how RSA works, and at that time i did not find any detailed information about math used in EEA.
So, i made implementation myself. 
This code calculates d and uses it to decrypt encrypted message. 
Values q and q generated with 'rsa' app and used here (in this 'eea' app).
